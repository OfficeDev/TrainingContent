# Create a Bot in Microsoft Teams
Microsoft Teams is a chat-based conversation tool that contains everything your team needs to keep in touch.  You can extend Teams by building Bots and Connectors, as well as extending the user interface with custom Tabs.  In this training module, weâ€™ll build a Bot that integrates with Teams.

## Prerequisites
1. You must have an Office 365 tenant and Windows Azure subscription to complete this lab. If you do not have one, the lab for **O3651-7 Setting up your Developer environment in Office 365** shows you how to obtain a trial.
1. You must have Visual Studio 2017 and the Bot templates installed.
   - Download the [Bot Application](http://aka.ms/bf-bc-vstemplate), [Bot Controller](http://aka.ms/bf-bc-vscontrollertemplate), and [Bot Dialog](http://aka.ms/bf-bc-vsdialogtemplate) .zip files. Install the project template by copying Bot Applicztion.zip  to your Visual Studio 2017 project templates directory. Install the item templates by copying Bot Controller.zip and Bot Dialog.zip to your Visual Studio 2017 item templates directory. The templates directories are traditionally located in `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Visual Studio 2017\Templates\`   
   ![Bot Template In Templates Directory](Images/BotTemplate.png)  
1. You must turn on Microsoft Teams for your organization and enable side-loading for your bots.
   - Follow the instructions in this link [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/setup](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/setup)
1. You must have Microsoft Teams installed.
   - Download it at this link [https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads](https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads).

## Exercise 1: Create a Bot in Azure
In this exercise, you will create a simple bot web application using Azure Bot Services.

1. In the Azure portal, click **+ New** and select **AI and Congitive Services**. Select **Web App Bot** from the list of services.
![Screenshot of the previous step](Images/B1.png)
1. In the **Bot name** textbox, enter a name for your Bot. Select a subscription, resource group, and pricing tier for your Bot. You may want to use the same resource group as in previous labs so your work is all together in Azure. The F0 tier is free, and will work fine for this lab. Ensure the **Basic (C#)** Bot template is selected, and click create. It may take a few minutes.
![Screenshot of the previous step](Images/B2.png)
1. Test your bot. Open the **Bot Services** blade and select your Bot. Under **Bot Management** click **Test in Web Chat**. Try chatting to your bot, and it will echo the messages back to you.
![Screenshot of the previous step](Images/B3.png)
Notice that each message is numberd; the Bot is keeping track of the number as part of a conversation. If you type "reset", the Bot will show a card to ask if you really want to reset. If you click Yes, the count will change back to 1. In the next step, you can examine th code in EchoDialog.cs to see how it works.
1. Next, modify your bot in the web user interface. To do that, click the Build button in the Web App Bot blade, and click on **Open online code editor**.
![Screenshot of the previous step](Images/B4.png)

    The editor looks a lot like Visual Studio Code. Open the Dialogs folder and, as a simple test, edit the EchoDialog.cs file. In the MessageReceivedAsync() method, find the line,

    ````csharp
    await context.PostAsync($"{this.count++}: You said {message.Text}");
    ````
    
    Edit the message in some simple way, such as changing "You said" to "I received".

    Open the console by clicking the button on the left.

    ![Screenshot of the previous step](Images/B5.png)

    Enter the command "Build.cmd", and your project should rebuild.

    >Note that the App Service Editor is in preview; if you get an error about kudu sync, pull down the dropdown in the top bar of the editor and select "Open Kudu Console". Type the commands:
    >```
    >cd site/wwwroot
    >build.cmd
    >```
    >The project should compile.

1. Return to the **Test in Web Chat** screen and try your service to see the change in effect. You may have to try a couple times as the site warms up.

1. Back in the Azure console, find your bot under Bot Services and click **Settings**. Above the **Microsoft App ID** field click the **(Manage)** link. Save a copy of the following information; you'll need it in the next exercise.
 - The name (this is your "Bot ID")
 - The Application ID (a GUID)
 - The Application Secret (you will need to Generate a New Password in order to have an opportunity to copy this)

    Keep the Application Secret in a safe place as it protects access to your bot application.

## Exercise 2: Bot development in Visual Studio

1. Ensure you are using the latest update of Visual Studio 2017, and that you have installed the Bot templates (links and other details above under "Prerequisites")
1. Launch **Visual Studio 2017** as an administrator
1. In Visual Studio 2017 select **File | New | Project**
1. Create a new Visual C# project using the **Bot Application** template  
![Screenshot of the previous step](Images/B6.png)  

1. Open the web.config file, and paste in the Bot ID, Application ID and Secret you saved in the previous exercise. (The Bot ID is just the name of the Bot).

1. Open the **Controllers\MessagesController.cs** class. Press ctrl+shift+B to build the project and resolve project namespaces. Replace the Post method with the following code.

	```csharp	
    public async Task<HttpResponseMessage> Post([FromBody]Activity activity)
    {
        if (activity.Type == ActivityTypes.Message)
        {
            ConnectorClient connector = new ConnectorClient(new Uri(activity.ServiceUrl));
            Activity reply;
            
			if (activity.Text.ToLower().Equals("what is our inventory of replacement tires?"))
            {
                Random random = new Random();
                reply = activity.CreateReply($"{random.Next(1,100)}");
            }
            else {
				// calculate something for us to return
            	int length = (activity.Text ?? string.Empty).Length;
            
                // return our reply to the user
                reply = activity.CreateReply($"You sent {activity.Text} which was {length} characters");
            }

            await connector.Conversations.ReplyToActivityAsync(reply);
        }
        else
        {
            HandleSystemMessage(activity);
        }
        var response = Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
        return response;
    }
	```
    
    Add a using statement at the top of the controller so it will compile.

    ``` csharp	
    using System;
    ```


1. Right click on the project and select **Manage Nuget Packages**. Click on the Updates tab and ensure all the packages are up-to-date. In particular, make sure the Microsoft.Bot.Builder is at version 3.12.2.4 or greater.
![Screenshot of the previous step](Images/B7.png)
You may need to update more than once until all the packages are up-to-date.

1. Right-click on the project and select **Publish...**. Click **Microsoft Azure App Service** and select the **Select Existing** radio button.

    ![Screenshot of the previous step](Images/B8.png)

    Now, click **Publish**. In the pop-up dialog, drill into the Bot web app you created in Exercise 1,and click OK. 

    ![Screenshot of the Previous Step](Images/B10.png)

    Click the **Settings** link (under **Summary**), and then click **Settings** again. Then click the **Settings** tab on the left and open the **File Publish Options** accordian. Ensure that **Remove additional files at destination** is checked off, then click Save.
 
    ![Screenshot of the Previous Step](Images/B9.png)

    Now click Publish again and Visual Studio will build your project and deploy it to Azure.

9. Re-test the Bot using the 
**Test in Web Chat** feature in the Azure portal. Try typing "what is our inventory of replacement tires?", which should respond with a random number.


## Exercise 3: Remote Debugging (optional)

When you start to develop more sophisticated bots, you may want to debug them. The [quickstart article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/dotnet/bot-builder-dotnet-quickstart) provides one approach, which allows local debugging using the [Bot Framework Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/bot-service-debug-emulator). Here we will remotely debug the Bot directly in Azure.

1. In Visual Studio 2017, right-click on the project and select **Publish...**. Click the **Settings** link and then the **Settings** tab. Change the configuration to **Debug**.

![Screenshot of the previous step](Images/B11.png)

Click **Save** then **Publish** to publish a debugger version of your Bot.

2. Open the **MessagesController.cs** file again and put your cursor on the **if** statement in the new Post method, and click F9 to set a breakpoint.

3. On the **View** menu, open the **Cloud Explorer**. Drill into the resource group you used for this project, and find the Bot Web Application. If the resource group doesn't show, you may need to log into the correct Azure subscription; click the person icon at the top of the Cloud Explorer to log in.

![Screenshot of the previous step](Images/B12.png)

 Once you've found the Bot Web Application, right click on it and select **Attach Debugger**.

4. When Visual Studio finishes connecting to the remote debugger, return to the test page in the Azure portal and type a message. You should hit the breakpoint and be able to debug your Bot.

## Exercise 4: Add bot to Microsoft Teams

1. In the Azure Portal under Bot Services, open your Bot and click **Channels**. Under "Add a featured channel", click the Teams logo.
<img src="Images/msteams.png" style="width:30px;">

    Agree to the terms of service if you want to complete the lab

1. Ensure the channel is enabled and click the **Done** button
![Screenshot of the previous step](Images/B13.png)

> **NOTE** At the time of this writing, there is a bug in which you also need to create a channel for Skype in order for Azure-registered Teams bots to work. This may or may be necessary to make the lab work.

### Configure Visual Studio to Package bot

Packaging a bot for Microsoft Teams is identical to packaging a tab. A manifest file (and related resources) are compressed into a zip file and added to a team.

Perform the following in Visual Studio. (Stop debugging before continuing.)

1. Right-click on the project, choose **Add | New Folder**. Name the folder **Manifest**.
1. Add the displayed files from the **Lab Files** folder of this repository.

    ![](Images/Exercise2-09.png)

1. Open the **manifest.json** file just added to the project.

    The **manifest.json** file requires several updates:
    - The `id` property must contain the app ID from registration. Replace the token `[microsoft-app-id]` with the app ID.
    - The `packageName` property must contain a unique identifier. The convention is to use the bot's URL in reverse format. Replace the token `[botUrl]` with the unique identifier from the Forwarding address.
    - Similarly, the `developer` property has three URLs that should match the hostname of the Messaging endpoint. Replace the token `[botUrl]` with the unique identifier from the Forwarding address.
    - The `botId` property (in the `bots` collection property) also requires the app ID from registration. Replace the token `[microsoft-app-id]` with the app ID.
    - Save and close the **manifest.json** file.

1. Update the Visual Studio project to compress the Manifest folder during build.
    - In Solution Explorer, right-click on the project and choose **Unload Project**. If prompted, click **Yes** to save changes.

        ![](Images/Exercise2-10.png)

    - Right-click on the project file and choose **Edit [project-name].csproj**. *(In the image, the project name is teams-bot1.)*

        ![](Images/Exercise2-11.png)

    - Scroll to the bottom of the file. Add the following Target to the file. *(Be sure to add the target outside of the comment.)* This target will invoke a custom build task to compress the files in the Manfest directory.

      ```xml
      <Target Name="AfterBuild">
        <ZipDir InputBaseDirectory="manifest"
                OutputFileName="$(OutputPath)\$(MSBuildProjectName).zip"
                OverwriteExistingFile="true"
                IncludeBaseDirectory="false" />
      </Target>
      ```

    - Add the following Task element to the **.csproj** file.

      ```xml
      <UsingTask TaskName="ZipDir" TaskFactory="CodeTaskFactory"
                AssemblyFile="$(MSBuildToolsPath)\Microsoft.Build.Tasks.v4.0.dll">
        <ParameterGroup>
          <InputBaseDirectory ParameterType="System.String" Required="true" />
          <OutputFileName ParameterType="System.String" Required="true" />
          <OverwriteExistingFile ParameterType="System.Boolean" Required="false" />
          <IncludeBaseDirectory ParameterType="System.Boolean" Required="false" />
        </ParameterGroup>
        <Task>
          <Reference Include="System.IO.Compression" />
          <Reference Include="System.IO.Compression.FileSystem" />
          <Using Namespace="System.IO.Compression" />
          <Code Type="Fragment" Language="cs"><![CDATA[
            if (File.Exists(OutputFileName))
            {
              if (!OverwriteExistingFile)
              {
                return false;
              }
              File.Delete(OutputFileName);
            }
            ZipFile.CreateFromDirectory
            (
              InputBaseDirectory, OutputFileName,
              CompressionLevel.Optimal, IncludeBaseDirectory
            );
          ]]></Code>
        </Task>
      </UsingTask>
      ```

    - Save and close the project file.
    - In **Solution Explorer**, right-click on the project and choose **Reload Project**.

1. Press **ctrl+shift+B** to build the project. The new AfterBuild target will run, creating a zip file in the build output folder (bin\\)

### Sideload app into Microsoft Teams

Now add he bot to a new or existing Team. If you already have a team, skip to step 4.

1. In the Microsoft Teams application, click the **Add team** link. Then click the **Create team** button.

    ![](Images/Exercise1-08.png)

1. Enter a team name and description. In this example, the Team is named **teams-bot-1**. Click **Next**.
1. Optionally, invite others from your organization to the team. This step can be skipped in this lab.
1. The new team is shown. In the left-side panel, click the ellipses next to the team name. Choose **Manage team** from the context menu.

    ![](Images/Exercise2-12.png)

1. On the View team display, click **Bots** in the tab strip. Then click the **Sideload a bot or app** link at the bottom right corner of the application.
1. Select the **teams-bot1.zip** file from the *bin* folder. Click **Open**.
1. The app is displayed. Notice information about the app from the manifest (Description and Icon) is displayed.

    ![](Images/Exercise2-13.png)

The app is now sideloaded into the Microsoft Teams application and the bot is available.

### Interact with the Bot

In the General channel for the team, a message is created announcing the bot has been added to the Team. To interact with the bot, @ mention the bot.

![](Images/Exercise2-14.png)

As you test the bot, you will notice that the character count is not correct. You can set breakpoints in the Visual Studio project to debug the code. (Remember, however, that the count was correct using the registration portal.) Later modules of this training will review how to remove mentions from the message.

8. In the chat window, type "what is our inventory of replacement tires?"

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:**  ***Do not copy and paste the question into the chat window.**  **Type it.*** Copy and pasting the text into the window may look correct, but it will not always work.

9. Observe the random number the Bot returns. 

Congratulations! You have created a simple Bot and added it to Microsoft Teams.
