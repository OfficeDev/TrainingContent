# Adaptive Cards in Microsoft Teams

In this demo, you will demonstrate a bot responding to users with cards instead of plain text.

## Prerequisites

Developing apps for Microsoft Teams requires preparation for both the Office 365 tenant and the development workstation.

For the Office 365 Tenant, the setup steps are detailed on the [Prepare your Office 365 Tenant page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/get-started/get-started-tenant).

### Download ngrok

As Microsoft Teams is an entirely cloud-based product, it requires all services it accesses to be available from the cloud using HTTPS endpoints. To enable the exercises to work within Microsoft Teams, a tunneling application is required.

This lab uses [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) for tunneling publicly-available HTTPS endpoints to a web server running locally on the developer workstation. ngrok is a single-file download that is run from a console.

## Update Demo solution

Make the following updates to the demo solution.

1. Launch Visual Studio 2017 as an administrator.

1. In Visual Studio 2017, select **File > Open > Project/Solution**.

1. Select the **officedev-talent-management.sln** file from the **Demos\03-adaptive-card** folder.

### Find the project URL

1. In Solution Explorer, double-click on **Properties**.

1. In the properties designer, select the **Web** tab.

1. Note the project URL.

### Run the ngrok secure tunnel application

1. Open a new **Command Prompt** window.

1. Change to the directory that contains the **ngrok.exe** application.

1. Run the command `ngrok http [port] -host-header=localhost:[port]`. Replace `[port]` with the port portion of the URL noted above.

1. The ngrok application will fill the entire prompt window. Make note of the forwarding address using HTTPS. This address is required in the next step.

1. Minimize the ngrok command prompt window. It is no longer referenced in this lab, but it must remain running.

### Register the bot

1. Go to the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/bots/new) and sign in. The bot registration portal accepts a work or school account or a Microsoft account.

> **NOTE:** You must use this link to create a new bot: https://dev.botframework.com/bots/new. If you select the **Create a bot button** in the Bot Framework portal instead, you will create your bot in Microsoft Azure instead.

1. Complete the **bot profile section**, entering a display name, unique bot handle and description.

    ![Screenshot of bot profile information page.](../../Images/Exercise1-04.png)

1. Complete the configuration section.
    - For the Messaging endpoint, use the forwarding HTTPS address from ngrok prepended to the route to the `MessagesController` in the Visual Studio project. In the example, this is `https://a2632edd.ngrok.io/API/Messages`.
    - Select the **Create Microsoft App ID and password button**. This opens a new browser window.
    - In the new browser window, the application is registered in Azure Active Directory. Select **Generate an app password to continue**.
    - An app password is generated. Copy the password and save it. You will use it in a subsequent step.
    - Select **OK** to close the dialog box.
    - Select the **Finish and go back to Bot Framework** button to close the new browser window and populate the app ID in the **Paste your app ID below to continue textbox**.

        ![Screenshot of configuration page with messaging endpoint and app ID displayed.](../../Images/Exercise1-05.png)

1. Move to the bottom of the page. Agree to the privacy statement, terms of use and code of conduct and select the **Register** button. Once the bot is created, select **OK** to dismiss the dialog box. The **Connect to channels** page is displayed for the newly-created bot.

> **Note:** The Bot migration message (shown in red) can be ignored for Microsoft5 Teams bots. Additional information can be found in the Microsoft Teams developer documentation, on the [Create a bot page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/bots/bots-create#bots-and-microsoft-azure).

1. The bot must be connected to Microsoft Teams. Select the **Microsoft Teams** logo.

    ![Screenshot of Microsoft Bot Framework with Microsoft Teams logo highlighted.](../../Images/Exercise1-06.png)

1. Once the connection is complete, ensure the connection is enabled and select **Done**. The bot registration is complete.

    >**Note:** Selecting **Settings** in the top navigation will re-display the profile and configuration sections. This can be used to update the messaging endpoint in the event ngrok is stopped, or the bot is moved to staging & production.

### Configure the web project

The bot project must be configured with information from the registration.

1. In **Visual Studio**, open the **Web.config** file. Locate the `<appSettings>` section.

1. Enter the `BotId`. The `BotId` is the **Bot handle** from the **Configuration** section of the registration.

1. Enter the `MicrosoftAppId` from the **Configuration** section of the registration.

1. Enter the `MicrosoftAppPassword`, the auto-generated app password displayed in the dialog box during registration.

    > **Note:** If you do not have the app password, the bot must be deleted and re-registered. An app password cannot be reset nor displayed.

1. Open the **manifest.json** file just added to the project. The `manifest.json` file requires several updates:
    - The `id` property must contain the app ID from registration. Replace the token `[microsoft-app-id]` with the app ID.
    - The `packageName` property must contain a unique identifier. The industry standard is to use the bot's URL in reverse format. Replace the token `[from-ngrok]` with the unique identifier from the forwarding address.
    - The `developer` property has three URLs that should match the hostname of the Messaging endpoint. Replace the token `[from-ngrok]` with the unique identifier from the forwarding address.
    - The `botId` property in the `bots` collection property also requires the app ID from registration. Replace the token `[microsoft-app-id]` with the app ID.
    - Save and close the **manifest.json** file.

1. Press **F5** to build the solution and package and start the web service in the debugger. The debugger will start the default browser, which can be ignored. The next step uses the teams client.

### Upload app into Microsoft Teams

Although not strictly necessary, in this lab the bot will be added to a new team.

1. In the Microsoft Teams application, select the **Add team** link. Then select the **Create team** button.

    ![Screenshot of Microsoft Teams with Create Team button highlighted.](../../Images/Exercise1-11.png)

1. Enter a team name and description. In this example, the team is named **teams-bot-1**. Select **Next**.

1. Optionally, invite others from your organization to the team. This step can be skipped in this lab.

1. The new team is shown. In the left-side panel, select the ellipses next to the team name. Choose **Manage team** from the context menu.

    ![Screenshot of Microsoft Teams with Manage Team highlighted.](../../Images/Exercise1-12.png)

1. On the Manage team display, select **Apps** in the tab strip. Then select the **Upload a custom app** link at the bottom right corner of the application.

1. Select the zip file from the **bin** folder that represents your app. Select **Open**.

1. The app is displayed. The description and icon for the app is displayed.

    ![Screenshot of Microsoft Teams with new app displayed.](../../Images/Exercise1-13.png)

    The app is now uploaded into the Microsoft Teams application and the bot is available.

    > **Note:** Adding the bot to a team invokes the system message **ConversationUpdated**. The code in `MessageHelpers.cs` determines if the message is in response to the bot being added, and initiates a 1:1 message with each member of the team.

    ![Screenshot of Microsoft Teams displaying new bot installed.](../../Images/Exercise1-14.png)

The bot is now installed and ready to run.

## View Adaptive cards in responses

1. In a channel, @ message the bot and issue the command `candidate John Smith 0F812D01`. The command must include a given name, a surname and a string as job identifier.

1. The bot will reply with an adaptive card showing candidate details. The candidate information is generated randomly and may change each time. The buttons are not implemented.

1. Show the `CommandHandler` class. Highlight the method at line 121, which attaches an adaptive card to the response.

1. Show the `CardHelper` class. Review the methods that build a card in code.
