# Demos

This directory contains the completed code for **teams-app1** in the [lab manual](../Lab.md). If you do not want to go through all the steps for building the app, you may run the completed code samples.

Keep in mind, some code configuration settings may be required to make the samples run and execute like the lab manuals demonstrate. Refer to the [lab manual](../Lab.md) for each exercise for more details.

To build the demo project(s), open a Command Window and execute the following commands:

```shell
npm install
gulp manifest
gulp serve
```

To upload the app into Microsoft Teams, refer to the [lab manual](../Lab.md).
