## Lab - Authentication and Single Sign-on

The lab for this module is available in multiple units within the associated Microsoft Learn module. Use the following links to jump to the specific unit. Each Microsoft Learn unit represents a different lab exercise & demo in the presentation.

1. [Exercise - Creating meeting apps for Microsoft Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/msteams-meetings-apps/3-exercise-create-meeting-app)

   In this exercise, you'll create a Microsoft Teams meetings app, install it into a new meeting, and interact with it before the meeting starts. This app will be used to organize and manage a product team's stand-up presentations to the rest of the team.

1. [Exercise - In-meeting experience & participant roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/msteams-meetings-apps/5-exercise-participants-in-meeting-experiences)

   In this exercise, you'll implement the in-meeting experience for the meeting and improve the existing pre-meeting experience. In the pre-meeting experience, organizers can approve and modify the presentations submitted by other meeting participants. In addition, the in-meeting experience will display a different experience depending on if the participant is a presenter, organizer, or attendee of the meeting in the side panel of the meeting.

1. [Exercise - Implement a post-meeting experience for attendees](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/msteams-meetings-apps/7-exercise-post-meeting-experience)

   In this exercise, you'll improve on the existing Microsoft Teams meetings app by implementing the post-meeting experience. The tab in the meeting will display the presentations delivered during the meeting and include the resources for each of the presentations that were submitted by the presenter in the pre-meeting experience.
