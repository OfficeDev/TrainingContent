# Demos - Office Outlook Add-ins
The three demos in the presentation use the exercises from the hands-on labs.

## Demo 1 - Create & Test Mail Add-in For Outlook
Do exercise 1 from the HOL, but don't dive into exploring the code. Tour the project, how to deploy & test in the Outlook web app & Outlook Windows desktop client.

## Demo 2 - Look at the Read & Compose Form Code
Look at the default code in the project's two forms. Explain how the URL no longer uses the /1.1/ or /1.2/ reference to the `Office.js` file. Instead, explain how it uses /1/ and the *Requirement set* setting in the manifest defines what is available.

## Demo 3 - Create a Translate Addin for a Compose Form
Do exercise 2 from the HOL.
