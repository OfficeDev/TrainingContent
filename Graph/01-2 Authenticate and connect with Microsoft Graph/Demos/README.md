# Microsoft Graph: Authenticate and Connect to Microsoft Graph - 200 Level

This folder contains demos for the Authenticate and Connect to Microsoft Graph module.

## Demos

- [REST via PowerShell](./01-rest-via-powershell)
- [OpenID Connect and ASP.NET MVC](./02-openid-connect)
- [Dynamic Permissions](./03-dynamic-permissions)

## Running demonstrations

Each demonstration is included as source code for convenience. However, several of the projects rely on other source code repositories. It is recommended that you obtain the original source and configure the projects according to the instructions in those repositories.

Each project has been updated to leverage configuration files when possible instead of editing source code files.
