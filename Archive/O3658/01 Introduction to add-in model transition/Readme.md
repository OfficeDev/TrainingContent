# 1 - Introduction to add-in model transition #

----------

This is the introduction module for the general add-in model transformation or transition. We concentrate on the reasoning behind the add-in model and on the process off approaching these kind of projects. We'll also tackle some of the key questions around farm solutions, sandbox solutions and the add-in model, including their differences and reasoning why we recommend the add-in model as the de-facto option for Office 365 and on-premises customizations.
