**Agenda**
- Introduction to building UX components using add-in model
- UX customizations with add-in model
- Client Side Rendering
- Practices for client side techniques


**Key recommendations**
- Itâ€™s not just about add-in parts 
- Remote provisioning and configuration
- Do not modify suite bar (top navigation)
- Careful JavaScript embedding is an option

**Lab - Modification of SharePoint User Experience**
In this lab you will learn how to modify SharePoint User Experience using SharePoint add-ins. In first lap you will be adding second level of navigation to out of the box master page without actual master page modifications by using JavaScript Embedding model. Second lab shows alternative for add-in part based experience on providing still end users capability to add new parts on the pages with responsive support.
