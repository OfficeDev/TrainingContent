Creating Client-Side Only Apps with Angular, ADAL & Microsoft Graph
===================================================================
Unlike other modules in this course (O3657) that focus on using non-Microsoft technologies, this module focuses on two key points:

- Using the Azure Active Directory ADAL JS library to leverage the OAuth2 implicit flow support for a 100% pure client-side solution.
- Leveraging the support for CORS in the Microsoft Graph & SharePoint REST API.

Unlike many of the labs in these training courses, this lab will demonstrate how to create an app will demonstrate creating apps from OS X using the freely available [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) editor by Adobe.
 
However, you can use any host operating system (*Windows, OS X, Linux, etc.*) and any text editor (*Visual Studio, Sublime Text, Atom, Brackets, WebStorm, EMACS, Vim, etc.*) to create the Office App. This is because Office Apps are simply text-based web applications (*HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & images*) with a single XML file to describe the application.
