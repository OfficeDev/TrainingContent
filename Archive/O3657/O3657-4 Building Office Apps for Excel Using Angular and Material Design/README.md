Building Office Add-ins for Excel Using Angular and Material Design
================================================================
Like other modules in this course (O3657), this module focuses on using non-Microsoft technologies. It has been written for developers working on OS X and not using Visual Studio as the development environment to create Office Add-ins. 

Many things in the module only apply to OS X. Be aware of this if you are using this lab on a Windows and/or Visual Studio based development environment.

If you are developing on Windows and using Visual Studio, refer to course [O3652 - Deep dive into the Office 365 Add-in Model](../../O3652) that contains modules that demonstrate how to create Office Add-ins using this type of an environment.

Unlike many of the labs in these training courses, this lab will demonstrate how to create an app from OS X using the freely available [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) editor by Adobe.
 
However you can use any host operating system (*Windows, OS X, Linux, etc*) and any text editor (*Visual Studio, Sublime Text, Atom, Brackets, WebStorm, EMACS, Vim, etc*) to create the Office Add-ins. This is because Office Add-ins are simply text-based web applications (*HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & images*) with a single XML file to describe the application.
