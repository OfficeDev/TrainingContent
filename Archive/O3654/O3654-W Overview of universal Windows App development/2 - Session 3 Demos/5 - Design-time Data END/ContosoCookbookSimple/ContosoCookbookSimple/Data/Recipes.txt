"directions":"Place flour and butter in a food processor and process on medium speed until only tiny lumps of butter remain. In a cup or small bowl, stir together water and egg yolk. Add yolk mixture to the butter and flour mixture. Process on medium speed until the mixture starts to clump together. Remove the processor blade and use your hand to press the dough clumps together into a mass. Tip the dough onto a large sheet of baking paper. Use your hands to bring the pastry together into a smooth ball. Form the pastry into a disc shape. Wrap pastry disc with plastic wrap or place in a freezer bag, and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Place unwrapped pastry disc between two large sheets of baking paper. Using a rolling pin, roll pastry out to fit a 23cm diameter quiche dish. The bottom sheet of baking paper may develop creases during rolling. These creases can make deep cuts in the pastry. To help prevent this, we do the following once or twice during rolling:  1) Leave the pastry between the two sheets of baking peer. Flip the paper and pastry over so the bottom sheet of baking paper is now on the top.  2) Lift the top sheet of baking paper off the pastry to remove the creases, and then place the paper down again and continue rolling.  Line dish with pastry. Using a sharp knife, trim away any pastry that extends above the top rim of the dish. Cover dish and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 190 degrees Celsius. If possible, set your oven so that the top and bottom elements are on and the fan, if present, is off. Adjust the oven rack to the lowest shelf position; the pastry base will brown and crisp better if it is close to the bottom element. If you have a fan-forced oven and aren't able to turn the fan off, set your oven to 170 degrees Celsius. Heat oil in a frying pan or saucepan over medium-high heat and cook onion, stirring occasionally, until softened but not browned, about 2-3 minutes. Add bacon to the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned . Remove pan from the heat and set asideto  cool. Line the pastry case with baking paper and half fill with raw rice, dried beans or pie weights.Bake pastry case for 15 minutes on the lowest oven rack. Remove weights and baking paper and brush pastry with the reserved egg white . Return pastry to oven and bake for a further 10 minutes on the lowest oven rack. While the pastry is baking, make the egg filling. Place eggs, cream, nutmeg, salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Whisk ingredients together until well combined. Sp rinkle cooled bacon and onion mixture over pastry case. Top with grated cheese.Gently pour egg mixture over the grated cheese.Move oven rack to the middle of the oven.

Get the leaves out the bunch of parsley and snip them in a glass with scissors. Juice up the lemon and place in a bowl. Prepare the breadcrumbs. You have several options to get breadcrumbs, the easy way is to buy ready to go breadcrumbs, the other option is to grate a really hard stale piece of bread using a box or zest grater, this is also achievable using a mortar grinder. If you do not have hard bread available, it is possible to make it hard using a toaster. You can use every kind of bread but I would recommend the use of farmhouse, wholemeal or rye bread.

Drain the rice and put it into the saucepan. Add water, oil, and salt, and bring to a boil. Once the water is boiling reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. Cook about 15 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the water has evaporated. Turn off the heat and fluff the rice with a fork. For a few minutes soak saffron in warm milk then gently fold the milk into the cooked rice. Vegetable And Gravy: Blend tomatoes to make a puree.In a bowl add yogurt, ginger, green chili, salt, turmeric, chili powder – mix it well. Add all the vegetables (cauliflower, beans, bell pepper, carrots, paneer, cashews, ginger and green chili) to the yogurt. Mix it well then let it marinate for 10 to 15 minutes. Heat the oil in a saucepan. Test the heat by adding one cumin seed to the oil; if seed cracks right away oil is ready. Add asafetida and cumnseeds. After the cumin seeds crack, add the tomato puree, and cook on medium-high heat. While cooking the tomato puree cover the pan so gravy does not splatter all over the burner. Cook until tomato mixture starts leaving oil and reduces to about half the volume. Add the marinated vegetables to tomato puree. Let it cook covered for 10 to 12 minutes on medium heat until vegetables are tender but not mushy. Stir the vegetables in between so they cook evenly.

"directions":"1 Put 1 1/2 quarts (6 cups) of water into a pot. Add 1 level tablespoon of kosher salt (or 2 level teaspoons if you are using table salt). Bring to a boil. Lower the heat to warm, cover and keep warm while you make the risotto.  2 In a large, wide saut? pan, heat olive oil and butter on medium heat. Add the onions and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. 3 Add arborio rice. Stir to coat. Cook, stirring, 5-7 minutes, until the rice just barely begins to brown on some of the grains. 4 Add the wine. Stir continuously, a few minutes, until the liquid has been completely absorbed by the rice.5 Lower the heat to medium low. Start adding the hot salted water to the rice, one ladleful (about 1/2 cup) at a time. After each addition, stir continuously for a few minutes until the rice has completely absorbed the liquid. Stir enough to keep the rice from sticking to the edge of the pan. Stirring continuously helps extract starch from the rice, to make a creamy sauce for the rice. You'll end up adding a total of about 4 to 5 cups of water, depending on the rice you are using (older rice may need more water). Continue to add water and stir, until the rice is cooked through and just a tiny bit chewy. The whole process should take about 30 minutes or so. Risotto is a labor of love. 6 Stir in 2 Tablespoons of the lemon juice, the lemon zest, chopped oregano, and black pepper, reserving a little bit of lemon zest and oregano to sprinkle on top upon service. Do a taste test. If the rice needs more seasoning, add more salt and pepper. Add more lemon juice if you want. To serve, sprinkle a little lemon zest and fresh oregano on top, along with a few toasted pine nuts and finely grated Parmesan if using. Use as an accompaniment to fish, shellfish, or lamb.",

"directions":"1 Brown lean ground beef in skillet until lightly browned and cooked through. Put a few layers of paper towels in large bowl. With slotted spoon, remove browned beef from skillet draining off excess beef fat and put on top of blotting towels. After all the browned beef has been removed from the skillet, drain off and dispose of excess beef fat. Wipe skillet clean with paper towel.Add diced green pepper and onion to skillet. Brown for a few minutes on medium high heat. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds more. Add browned beef back to the skillet, lower the heat to low and continue to cook for 5 more minutes stirring frequently. 2 Transfer browned beef, green pepper and onions to 3 Qt. pot. Add tomato sauce, tomato paste. Open stewed tomatoes and dice, then add to 3 Qt. pot. Add oregano, parsley, Italian Spice Mix to taste, probably 2 teaspoons of each. Add a pinch of garlic powder and a pinch of garlic salt, to taste. Add a dash of white wine vinegar. Add sugar a tablespoon at a time, until desired level of sweetness, no more than 1/4 cup of sugar. Note that it is hard to follow a pure recipe when it comes to pasta sauce. One Italian spice mix is not like the other, nor is one can of tomato sauce not like the other. So you really do need to taste the sauce as you are adding the spices, sugar and vinegar. Stir and allow sauce to simmer 15-45 minutes to thicken .Remove from heat.3 Cook lasagna noodles in 6 Qt. Pot per cooking directions.Stir often to prevent from sticking and be sure that water remains at a boil during the entire cooking to prevent noodles from sticking. I add Tbsp of salt to the water so the noodles are more flavorful. Drain in colander and place in a cool water filled pan to keep from drying out and sticking together.4 In dry lasagna pan, ladle one cup of sauce and spread along the bottom of the pan. Apply a layer noodles 3 length wise (edges overlapping). Ladle in sauce sparingly into center trough of 3 noodles. Apply a layer of mozzarella cheese slices on top of lasagna sauce. Place ricotta cheese dollops every 2 inches in center of noodles on top of mozzarella cheese slices, sprinkle grated parmesan cheese in thin even layer on top of ricotta cheese. Apply second layer of noodles, topping again with sauce and cheese. Finish with another layer of noodles. If you have extra sauce and cheese you can spread that over the top. Tent lasagna pan with aluminum foil (not touching noodles or sauce). Bake at 375°F for 45 minutes. Allow to cool before serving.Note - Flavor improves for second service and may be reheated in convention or microwave. Leave aluminum tent on for storage. ",

"directions":"1 If you are starting with somewhat old, dried out tortillas, great. If not and you are starting with relatively fresh tortillas, put them on a baking sheet and put them in the oven at 200°F for 10-15 minutes to dry them out a bit. It is best to start with tortillas that don't have a lot of moisture in them. Cut tortillas in half, and then cut the halves into 1/4-inch wide strips. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a 3-quart pot. Working in three batches, fry the tortilla strips in the oil, until lightly browned and crisp. Remove the tortilla strips from the pan and let drain on a paper-towel-lined plate. 2 Add the chopped onions to the pan, cook 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the chopped chile and cook for 2-3 minutes more, until the onions and chiles have softened. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds more. Add the broth, tomatoes, and salt. Increase the heat to high, heat until the soup begins to boil, then reduce the heat to a low simmer, cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the shredded chicken and cook until heated through. 3 To serve, pit, peel, and cut the avocado into 1-inch pieces. Divide half of tortilla strips among 4 individual serving bowls; ladle in soup. Top with avocado and cheese; garnish with remaining tortilla strips and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges.",
