#Demo 2 - Using the REST API for Creates, Updates & Deletes

## Demo REST Using Fiddler
Open a browser, navigate to a SharePoint site and create a new list. Then add a few items to the list... or use the list you created in the previous demo

Next, open Fiddler and use the existing authenticated session to demonstrate how to do simple HTTP POSTs & DELETEs. Specifically demonstrate the following concepts:

- If-Match
- X-Http-Method
- X-RequestDigest
- How to submit data to the service
