#Demo 1 - Sequential + Web Service Demo

Use the **Completed Solution** form the lab exercise 1 in this demo: **UpdateListItem**.

After opening, change the **Start URL** property of the SharePoint Hosted App to point to a SharePoint Developer site. Deploy & demonstrate the app.

After explaining the workflow, take a moment to explain how debugging works with the console app as well as the differences between a SharePoint 2013 on-premises and SharePoint Online site. Specifically explain and demonstrate how to setup Service Bus as shown in this post: [Debugging SharePoint 2013 workflows using Visual Studio 2013](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/officeapps/archive/2013/10/30/debugging-sharepoint-2013-workflows-using-visual-studio-2013.aspx).

Make sure to demonstrate by adding a **WriteLine** activity that outputs the response from one of the OData service calls.

Also show how you can add annotations the activities in the workflow.
