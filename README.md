## Cloning this repository

This repo of training content was initially created in 2014. Since then, there have been a significant number of commits containing a a large number of files. [In early 2020, we archived](#archived-content) a lot of the outdated content from this repo to a dedicated "archive" repo.

However, there is still a long & rich history.

If you are only interested in the content in the current state of the repo and none of the history, consider performing a *shallow clone*, cloning only the most recent commit. You can do this using the following statement:

```shell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/OfficeDev/TrainingContent.git
```

## Archived content

In early 2020, we migrated outdated content from this repo to a new archive repo: **[OfficeDev/TrainingContent-Archive](https://www.github.com/OfficeDev/TrainingContent-Archive)**. This includes all the content from the **Archive** folder & other retired modules. This was done to make it easier to download & clone this repository.

## NOTE - Content "Freshness"

Note that some of the materials might be slightly out of date due to the speed of innovation in Office 365. **We do welcome fixes and feedback from the community**, which is a great way to get recognized in the monthly summaries and in our other public messaging.
