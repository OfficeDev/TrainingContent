# Office Add-ins: Build Office Add-ins for Word

Microsoft Office clients enable developers to create add-ins that extend Microsoft Word with custom functionality. Through a JavaScript API, developers can manipulate the content in a Word document from an app running in the task pane.

In this module, you'll learn how to build a Word add-in that inserts (and replaces) text ranges, paragraphs, images, HTML, tables, and content controls. You'll also learn how to format text and how to insert (and replace) content in content controls.
