# Working with different JavaScript frameworks and libraries #

----------

Implementing CRUD operations on SharePoint data in client side web parts with Angular and Knockout frameworks, using multiple JavaScript libraries in client side web parts to read and render  SharePoint data. 

## Video ##
- Module 7: Working with different JavaScript frameworks and libraries - Coming

## Agenda ##
- Different options to load JavaScript libraries
- Angular 1.x
- Knock-out

## Key recommendations ##
- Client side web parts are framework agnostic. You can use any client side framework that you like: Angular, Knockout, React, Handlebars, and more.
- You need install the typings for the packages you add, because Typescript depends on it for compiling.
- Configuring Non-AMD libraries as external resources is different than AMD, UMD or CommonJS modules.
- Any dependencies you add are bundled by default.
- Avoid bundling when not needed to keep the web part bundle as small as possible.
- Use the WebPack visualizer to inspect web part bundles.

## Lab - Working with different JavaScript frameworks and libraries ##
In these labs, you will enhance the web parts created in the [Getting Started with the SharePoint Framework (SPFx)](../Module-1/Lab.md) module.  First, you will implement CRUD operations on SharePoint data in both Angular and Knockout client-side web parts.  Then you will use multiple JavaScript libraries (jQuery, Chartist, Moment) to manipulate the SharePoint data and render it in a chart.
